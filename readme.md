#`bayes`: A Naive-Bayes classifier for node.js


`bayes` takes a document (piece of text), and tells you what category that document belongs to.

##What can I use this for?

You can use this for categorizing any text content into any arbitrary set of **categories**. For example:

- is an email **spam**, or **not spam** ?
- is a news article about **technology**, **politics**, or **sports** ?
- is a piece of text expressing **positive** emotions, or **negative** emotions?

##Installing

```
npm install bayes
```

##Usage

```javascript
var bayes = require('bayes')

var classifier = bayes()

// teach it positive phrases

classifier.learn('amazing, awesome movie!! Yeah!! Oh boy.', 'positive')
classifier.learn('Sweet, this is incredibly, amazing, perfect, great!!', 'positive')

// teach it a negative phrase

classifier.learn('terrible, shitty thing. Damn. Sucks!!', 'negative')

// now ask it to categorize a document it has never seen before

classifier.categorize('awesome, cool, amazing!! Yay.')
// => 'positive'

// serialize the classifier's state as a JSON string.
var stateJson = classifier.toJson()

// load the classifier back from its JSON representation.
var revivedClassifier = bayes.fromJson(stateJson)

```

##API

###`var classifier = bayes([options])`

Returns an instance of a Naive-Bayes Classifier.

Pass in an optional `options` object to configure the instance. If you specify a `tokenizer` function in `options`, it will be used as the instance's tokenizer. It receives a (string) `text` argument - this is the string value that is passed in by you when you call `.learn()` or `.categorize()`. It must return an array of tokens. The default tokenizer removes punctuation and splits on spaces.

Eg.

```js
var classifier = bayes({
    tokenizer: function (text) { return text.split(' ') }
})
```

###`classifier.learn(text, category)`

Teach your classifier what `category` the `text` belongs to. The more you teach your classifier, the more reliable it becomes. It will use what it has learned to identify new documents that it hasn't seen before.

###`classifier.categorize(text)`

Returns the `category` it thinks `text` belongs to. Its judgement is based on what you have taught it with **.learn()**.

###`classifier.probabilities(text)`

Returns an array of `{ value, category }` objects with probability calculated for each category. Its judgement is based on what you have taught it with **.learn()**.

###`classifier.toJson()`

Returns the JSON representation of a classifier.

###`var classifier = bayes.fromJson(jsonStr)`

Returns a classifier instance from the JSON representation. Use this with the JSON representation obtained from `classifier.toJson()`
